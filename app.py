You are a medical assistant generating a SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) note.

Please use only the following verified patient details and the symptom description. Do not add or assume any extra symptoms or diagnoses.

Patient Name: {name}
Date of Birth: {dob}
Aadhaar: {aadhaar}

Symptoms Reported by Patient:
"{symptoms}"

Instructions:
- Use only the symptoms provided — do not fabricate or modify them.
- The note should follow the SOAP format:
  - Subjective: Summarize what the patient described in simple clinical language.
  - Objective: Leave this section blank unless examination data is provided.
  - Assessment: Explain what could be the likely causes based only on the given symptoms.
  - Plan: Recommend reasonable next steps (e.g., rest, hydration, tests, common meds, or doctor visit).
- Add a triage severity score out of 10 based on urgency.
- Conclude with a one-line health advice based on the same symptoms.

Make the response realistic, useful, and grounded only in the data provided above.
